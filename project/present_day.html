            <p>	Drone use in todayâ€™s society is quite prevalent, and we have significantly evolved from what drone use was beforehand, such as a balloon carrier, to slowly flying overhead and conducting operations or even to pilot-based aircraft turned pilotless (or, as some will know, the term unmanned). Consumer-based drones can be about as small as the palm of your hand to even remotely the size of typical model planes that most built when they were little. Even most would be aware of the Amazon Drones that are available in most cities that deliver your packages and other goods as well to you without the need for human interaction. However, there is always a downfall to flying drones on a consumer level (and even on some business levels too). First, there are significant guidelines that must be followed if you want to fly a drone, that includes how much it weighs and registering it with the FAA; in addition, you also must pass the FAA-issued test to be able to become certified to fly it. It is also the commonsense logic of what to do and what not to do with drones from a consumer standpoint, such as: not flying intoxicated, not flying above a certain height, and a big one is not flying near any aircraft. Government use can only be said of so much without giving anything away and can only be noted of what happens on the news or what is posted on the internet and can be discussed that would not compromise the integrity or classification status of the aircraft.</p>
