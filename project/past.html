        <p>The start of the use of drones is uncertain; much like things in the past, documentation of things and records with at least some substantial amount of evidence can help significantly find where things originated from. However, the first start of drones falls into this category, and no one can pinpoint when such a concept started. The first use of drones can date back to the summer of July when the Austrian forces launched their use of air power to attack Venice. However, that plan did not go as planned as weather and other factors deterred the balloons and made the challenge for the attacks much harder to conduct on the scale they were planning on. Then we converted one piloted aircraft into pilotless aircraft during the World War, which set off the chain reaction for how the war was fought. Nikola Tesla was also a prominent figure in aid of pilotless aircraft and the manufacturing of them to bring to the warfare masses during the pre-war era. It also devised the RC plane as well in addition to the fleet pilotless aerial torpedoes and being able to control the bombs remotely without the use of a pilot in the cockpit of the plane.</p>
