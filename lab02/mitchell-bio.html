        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p>My name is <strong>Devante Mitchell</strong> and I am 27 years old.</p>

        <h2>More information:</h2>
        <p>I am a junior at Syracuse University going for information management and technology, but my concentration in the field I am studying for is to work on digital marketing and promoting an helping businesses brand their images and prodcuts online to give them more of a better presence.</p>

        <h2>Accomplishments and skills:</h2>
        <p>I have served two deployments and nearly three with the United States Army; in addition, I have spent nearly a decade working with the United States government and don't think I will be getting tired of doing that for the most part. Also to add on, <strong>I am Microsoft Certified</strong>, so I can work my way around doing anything Microsoft within the nook and cranny of it.</p>

        <h2>Outside of work life:</h2>
        <p>My life outside of school and work is more the complete opposite of being hectic and running around constantly, with that I am more reserved and kept to myself and also do not mind a good time to drive around to discover new places to go or kicking back with a great playlist to make the day worth it. To add to that, I also do not mind a subtle drink after a long day.</p>
